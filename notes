FDF - Notes & Planning


Aim:

Render a 3d wireframe, reading its coords from a plain text file.

This project utilises the graphics library MiniLibX, which provides the tools needed to open a window, create images and handle keyboard and mouse events.


General Instructions:

Project is written in C, following the Norm.
No crashes or mem leaks.
Makefile with $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, re
Any bonuses must be compiled with a 'bonus' makefile rule.
Bonuses must be in a different file with format *_bonus.{c/h}
You can use libft
Submit in school git repo.


Permitted external functions:
- open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
- All functions from math library:
	- -lm compiler option
	- man 3 math
- All functions from MiniLibX


Project specific instructions:
- You must use MiniLibX
- You must turn in a non-relinking makefile
- No global vars

- Program must render an isometric projection.
- Coords are stored in a .fdf plain-text file, passed as a param to the program.
- Horizontal position is the axis, vertical is ordinate and vale is altitude.

- program must display image in a window
- Window mgmt must be smooth (i.e. you can switch windows, minimize, etc)
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program.
- Clicking the cross in the window's frame must quit the program.
- The use of 'images' from MiniLibX is mandatory.

- decided to use this library instead of minilibx
- github repo: 



TODO:

- make a parser for the maps
	- TESTS!
		- consider validation process.
		- build a load of test maps, write a script to run them all.
		- check return value and error message.
		- check argv and option flags are handled properly
			- no args
			- invalid args
		- check file has '.fdf' extention
		- check file can be opened for reading
		- maps must be of equal width.
		- do we need a value range for altitudes?
		- what happens with one value?
		- what happens with no values?
		- what happens with just whitespace?
		- what happens with invalid values?
