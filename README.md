## Overview

This project serves as an introduction to graphical programming. The aim is to right a program that renders an isometric image from a matrix of numbers in a file. A library was used to spawn the window and plot individual pixels but besides that the entire program was written by myself using C.

I learned a lot about the challenges of graphical programming in the early days of computing. I also learned some interesting new mathematical concepts, as some geometry was needed to render an isometric projection.
